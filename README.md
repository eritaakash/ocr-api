This API is made for experimental purposes. Therefore, am keeping it very basic at the moment. Being a personal project, but also a bit useful one, am keeping it public.

#### Features
- Uses `tesseract.js` for performing OCR.
- - Support for 99 languages. see `languages.js`
- Uses `express` for building API.

#### To-do
- Add support for processing multiple images per single request.
